# 1. Static Testing 
- Testing Project releated document is called as Static Testing.
- Analysis of a program carried out without executing the program
Done during verification process i.e before development
- As we know 85% errors found in desgin phase
Is code is tested in static testing ? “No” || the documentation is tested
- Software development starts, continues, and ends with documentation
Early documentation → is used to defi ne the software to be built.
- Later documentation covers → the software training, installation, and operation (user guides)..
Static = not while running
- The primary goal of static testing is reduce defect by reducing defects in the
documentation from which the software is developed.
