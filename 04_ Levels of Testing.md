# Levels of Testing : 

# 1. Unit Testing : (white box technique)
   - a unit is single module or component of software
   - unit testing is conduted on single program or single module
   - it is white box testing technique conducted by developer
     
# Unit testing technique : 

1. Basis Path testing
2. control structure testing
3. conditional coverage
4. loops coverage
5. mutation

# 2. Integration Testing : 
- Integration testing is performed between 2 or more module
- It focuses on checking data communication between multiple module
- It is white box testing technique
- Main Purpose of Integration Testing :
To check moudules are communicating each other as DFD Data Flow Diagram which is specified in
TDD ( Technical Document Diagram )

 # Types of Incremental Testing
 - Inceremental Inegration testing
 - Non Inceremental Integration testing

# When to Perform Incremental Testing

- Software incremental testing involves interlinking each component individually rather than combining them all at once.
- This is performed only if all the defects detected at the unit testing phase have been fixed.
- The best time to use incremental testing is when software components are still being developed.
- The drivers and stubs can be used for any unfinished components if required during testing.
- For example, if modules 2 and 3 are still under development during the testing phase of modules 1, 2, and 3.
- In that case, drivers can be combined with module 1 to replicate the unfinished module and continue the integration process.

 # 1. Inceremental Inegration testing
 - Incrementally adding the module and testing the data between the module
 - It has 2 approches :
 - TOP - DOWN
 - BOTTOM UP

   # TOP DOWN Inceremental Inegration testing :
   
   - Top-Down Incremental Integration Testing means you start testing from the top-level modules and add lower-level modules step by step. You use stubs to simulate modules that arenâ€™t ready yet. As you move down, you replace stubs with real modules and keep testing.
   - Stubs are used as a substitute if any lower-level module is unavailable for testing or under development.
   - Stubs, also called programs, are dummy programs that replace any lower-level module in a top-down hierarchy.
   - They are as higher-level modules call them to check the interface and integration.
   - For example,
  - If you have already checked the Log module and need to integrate it with the FPP module, but FPP is still under development,
  -  a stub can be used to replace FPP. In this case, the integration hierarchy will go down with Log, PLP, and PDP modules.
  -  If any other lower-level modules are missing, they can also be replaced by stubs.
