# Functional Testing vs. Non-Functional Testing

## Functional Testing
- **Focus**: Ensures that the software functions as expected, performing its intended tasks.  
- **What It Checks**: Specific features, actions, and behaviors outlined in the requirements.  

## Non-Functional Testing
- **Focus**: Evaluates how well the software performs under various conditions and assesses aspects beyond specific functionalities.  
- **What It Checks**: Performance, security, usability, and other aspects related to the user experience.  

## Major Difference
- **Functional Testing** → About **WHAT** the software does (ensuring individual features work correctly).  
- **Non-Functional Testing** → About **HOW WELL** the software performs (assessing speed, security, and overall user experience).
