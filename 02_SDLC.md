# SDLC - Software Devlopment Life Cycle
    - SDLC is process used by software industry to design,develop and test the software.

1. Requirement Analysis :
     - collect requiremnt
     - understand the requirements
2. Design :
     - Designing the software

3. Development :
     - Developing the software (actual coding takes place here )
       
4. Testing :
     - Before delivering the software the testing is done.

5. Maintaince :
     - Deplyoing the software
     - user using the software

# Types of Models in SDLC 
1. Waterfall / linear model
2. V model
3. Spiral model

# 1.Waterfall/Linear Model :

- it is old and traditional model
- It is linear model i.e. steps 1 after another
- Each phase must complete to start new phase ( i.e called one after another)
- In waterfall module quality of product is good because every phase has clear
Documentation
- SRS (system requirement specification ) not changed hence no bug
- Initial investment is less because no tester involved
- no changes in middle
- testing will start after coding

# 2. V shaped Model :

- verification and validation
- Verification → done before development → check we are doing correct ?

- Validation → Actually testing software → done after software ready → done Right ?

      Review : is type of static testing | done before execution
      - Review is a process or meeting during which a work product or set of work products, is
      - presented to managers, users, customers, or other interested parties for comment or

      Walkthroug Review :
      • It is not a formal process
      • It is led by the authors
      • Author guide the participants through the document according to his or her thought process
        to achieve a common understanding and to gather feedback.
      • Useful for the people if they are not from the software discipline, who are not used to or
      cannot easily understand software development process.

      Insepction Review:
      It is the most formal review type
      It is led by the trained moderators
      During inspection the documents are prepared and checked thoroughly by the reviewers before the meeting
