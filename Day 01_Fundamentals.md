# What is Software 
    - Definition: Collection of computational program that helps us to perform a task
    Types :
    1. System Software : Device driver,os,server

  # Why SOftware has Bugs ?
    - 1. Miscommunication / no communication
      2.  software complexity
      3.  programming errors
      4.  changing requirement
