 # System Testing : 

 - System testing is the process of testing a fully integrated software system to verify that it meets all specified requirements.
 - It is performed after integration testing.
 - in this testing we can test whole application (complete / integrated software is tested).


# System Testing Process :
       - System testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle
         that ensures the complete application functions as intended before release.
         It involves validating both functional and non-functional requirements
         through a structured process that includes planning, design, execution, and closure.


# Why is System Testing Important? 
 
 It verifies the system as a whole to ensure it performs as expected.

- Reduces risks: Identifies critical issues before deployment
- Ensures quality: Validates both functionality and performance
- Prevents defects: Catches integration and interaction issues early
- Provides confidence: Confirms readiness for production release

# When is System Testing Performed?

- System testing is performed after integration testing and before user acceptance testing (UAT).
- It is done once all components have been integrated and the system is ready for end-to-end testing against the requirements.
