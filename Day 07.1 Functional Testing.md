# Functional Testing 

- Functionality is nothing but behaviour of application.
- functional testing talks about how your feature should work.
- What It Checks: Verifies that each part of the software performs its job correctly.
- Example: Testing if login, search, and other functions work as intended.

# Functional Testing types
1. Object Properties Testing
2. Database Testing
3. Error Handling Testing
4. Calculations/Manipulations Testing
5. Links Testing
6. Cookies & Sessions Testing


# 1. Object Properties Testing

- Object Properties Testing in functional testing ensures that visual elements (like buttons,
text boxes) in the application have the right characteristics. It checks if these objects behave
as expected based on their defined properties.

- Example: Verifying that a "Submit" button is visible, clickable, and has the correct color
according to the application's design.

# 2. Database Testing

- Database Testing for functional testing ensures that the application interacts correctly with
its database. It checks if data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated accurately within the
database.
- Example: Confirming that user details entered through a registration form are correctly
saved and can be retrieved when logging in.

# 3. Error Handling Testing

- Error Handling Testing focuses on functional aspects related to how the application deals
with errors. It checks if the system shows appropriate error messages and handles
unexpected situations gracefully without crashing

- Example: Testing the system's response when a user tries to submit a form with missing
information, ensuring it displays a helpful error message.

# 4. Calculations/Manipulations Testing

- Calculations/Manipulations Testing in functional testing assesses the accuracy of numeric
operations and data manipulations performed by the application. It ensures that
calculations yield correct results.

- Example: Testing an e-commerce application to ensure that the total price of items in a
shopping cart is accurately calculated.

# 5. Links Testing

- The testing is focus on Links existence and Links execution.
- Links Testing in functional testing verifies that hyperlinks within the application work as
expected. It checks if users are directed to the correct pages, ensuring a smooth and
functional navigation experience.
- Example: Clicking on menu links in a website and confirming that each link leads to the
intended page or performs the correct action.
-  Types of links:
– Internal Links
– External Links
– Broken Links

# 6. Cookies & Sessions Testing

- Cookies & Sessions Testing in functional testing evaluates how well the application manages
user-specific information. It checks if session-related functionalities, such as login
persistence, work as intended.

- Example: Logging into an online account, closing the browser, reopening it, and confirming
that the user remains logged in due to the correct handling of cookies or session data.
